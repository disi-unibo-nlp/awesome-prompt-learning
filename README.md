## üåü What's Prompt Learning?

Prompt Learning in the context of large language models (LLMs) refers to an automatic technique where task-specific instructions are provided as part of the input prompt to guide the model's behavior without modifying its underlying parameters. This method leverages the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs and helps them generalize across various text downstream tasks such as text classification, summarization, translation, and question-answering withoud doing any form of fine-tuning.
